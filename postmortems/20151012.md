-Better soldering irons
-More solder
-Bigger space in PCBs

-Split workshops into two: 

1) One with lecture, contact mic build, prebuilt listening kits, tour, how to record/special questions/topics

2) One intermediate with how circuit works building amps on pcb board

Day 1: 

Went well, need more time to set up chairs, projectors, tables. Lecture went well

Day 2: 

Not so good. Soldering custom printed PCBs a terrible decision. No one finished.
